# CharCoin Smart Contract (Solana)

### Transparent Donations • DAO Governance • Dynamic Staking • Deflationary Tokenomics

---

## Overview

CHAR Coin is a Solana-based smart contract system built using the Anchor framework and Rust. It implements a decentralized ecosystem for:

* Stake-based DAO governance
* Transparent, automated donation fund allocation
* Buyback and burn deflation mechanics
* Dynamic staking with time-based rewards
* Multisig-secured marketing and treasury fund control
* Emergency halt for contract protection

All modules have passed internal audits and comprehensive unit testing. For more details, please refer to the Official White Paper: [https://charcoin.org/charcoin-white-paper/](https://charcoin.org/charcoin-white-paper/)

---

## Development Environment

* Rust: `1.87.0`
* Anchor CLI: `0.31.1`
* Solana CLI: `2.1.17`
* Test Path: `tests/charcoin.ts`

## Program Modules

| Module         | Description                                                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lib.rs`       | Entry point and global instruction router                                              |
| `burn.rs`      | Buyback and deflationary burn functions                                                |
| `staking.rs`   | Locking, staking, and dynamic reward distribution                                      |
| `donation.rs`  | Charity registration, voting, and distribution logic                                   |
| `marketing.rs` | Multisig marketing wallet management and release rules                                 |
| `security.rs`  | Emergency halt mechanism and multisig verification                                     |
| `rewards.rs`   | Additional reward systems, including lottery-style and volume-based bonuses (optional) |
| `errors.rs`    | Centralized error handling and custom error codes                                      |

## Unit Testing

Run:

```bash
anchor test
```

**Test Summary:**
All 20 core instructions and flows are passing:

* Stake / Unstake / Claim / Penalty logic
* Emergency halt triggers
* Buyback + burn execution
* DAO: Proposal → Vote → Finalize
* Marketing + donation fund release (multisig)
* DAO treasury: withdraw / approve / execute

**Execution Time:** ≈ 42 seconds

---

## Security Features

* Multisig Authorization: All fund releases (marketing, donations, DAO treasury) are protected by multisig thresholds.
* Emergency Halt: Critical instructions can be paused upon detection of suspicious behavior.
* DAO Governance: Voting power is locked to staking participation; only staked tokens (min 15 days) are eligible to vote.
* Audit Readiness: Fully modular code, deterministic execution paths, and descriptive events for audit traceability.

## Tokenomics Structure

CHAR Coin uses a fixed **1% transaction fee**, distributed as:

| Category                    | Allocation | Description                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Buyback & Marketing         | 10%        | Includes burn wallet and two multisig marketing funds                 |
| Charity Donations & Rewards | 75%        | Community-driven voting for recipients; includes lottery reward pools |
| Staking Incentives          | 15%        | Distributed across time-locked staking pools                          |

Reward rates are **dynamically adjusted** based on:

* Total staked token volume
* Daily/weekly transaction activity
* Lock-in duration (30/90/180 days)

---

## DAO Governance

Governance follows a proposal–vote–finalize structure. Key mechanics:

* Proposals: Any eligible staker can submit
* Voting Period: Defined by system configuration
* Weight: Proportional to staked tokens
* Finalization: On-chain vote tally and execution

---

## Charity Voting System

* Cause Registration: Any verified organization can be listed
* User Voting: Monthly vote window; 1 vote per wallet
* Distribution: Weighted fund release after vote closure
* Annual Reserve: 20% of funds are pooled for yearly distribution

## Audit Readiness

The repository is structured for third-party audit access:

* Full instruction coverage with unit tests
* Clear event logs for transaction tracing
* Multisig-secured flows for critical operations
* Configurable constants for fee and reward logic

The smart contract has been audited and the full Certik audit report is available in the `Audit` folder.

For questions or integration support, please open an issue on this repository.
